                I am Lindsey Wall. Ive grown up in the most beautiful santa cruz mountains. Ive always been taken by
                music. Since I was little, I found myself running up to any stage at any little music venue or anytime
                eating dinner at the restaurant down the road from our house (Don Quixotes then) Any time I saw a
                musician perform on that stage, I was always so inspired struck with a deeper knowing. A deeper knowing
                that this is what I’m here for. That I don’t just want to do this, but I need to. I need to pour my
                heart out in the form of song, and as I’ve grown older, I’ve found that I also need to write about my
                experiences to move through them. For a while I fought this. Going to school, Trying to take a path that
                wasn’t mine, something that seemed “safer”. Time after time music has been what I come home to. Last
                year I released my first album which was a 5 song EP. Being the first time in the studio, I was a little
                directionless, but enjoyed so much being a part of bringing my songs to life in a big studio. I only
                released a few of my favorites onto most online platforms. Just a few months later, I was contacted by
                someone who works for American Idol. Somewhat shocked and honestly pretty skeptical of how real this
                email or this person was, I read on to find that this was in fact a real woman from the show talking
                about a song she had heard off my album. After months of auditions and hoops to jumps through, I made it
                to and through the televised round and a couple more after that. Prior to being contacted, the show was
                wasn’t something that I was necessarily striving for. It didn’t seem crucial in my path and what I want
                to do in music. But, I am ever so thankful I had those experiences. I learned more about music and the
                industry in that time period than I ever have in my life. And I learned how hard you have to work to
                obtain a career in music. Coming out of that, I’m ambitious to write and record an album with newer
                knowledge. And to do it in my own way and in my own time. I want to love every single song, because I
                want you to love it, too. I will be more bold, honest and open in my writing than I ever have been. I
                can’t wait to share this with you.
